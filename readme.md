# Way0utwest Database Project

This is a project for tracking things about my life which I can use in demos and for miscellaneous practice. I am using a DevOps flow with Redgate tools to examine how I can adjust and evolve a database over time.

Each of the sections below will cover specific items that I care about tracking.

## Solar Tracking

We invested in a solar system, and while there is real time and live monitoring from a service, I worry they may lose data over time. This gives me a way to track my data over time and have a backup of what they are tracking. I can also run reports on raw data and compare this with estimates.
